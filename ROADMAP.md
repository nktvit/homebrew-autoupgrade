# Roadmap

A running list of things to fix, polish, or build. Loosely prioritised.

## 1.0.1 — shipped

- [x] **`wait` + `set -e` reachability bug** — the "continue with stale data" branch was unreachable because `set -e` killed the script on `wait` of a failed `brew update`. Fixed by reaping the process via `if ! wait`.
- [x] **`brew au` alias** — added `cmd/brew-au` symlink so the short form works for every subcommand.
- [x] **Symlink-aware `SCRIPT_PATH`** — plist always points at the canonical script even when invoked via the alias.
- [x] **Self-upgrade detection** — log a line when `brew update` pulls a newer version of this script into the tap.

## 1.0.2 — shipped (wizard polish)

- [x] **Default schedule is now time window** instead of "Anytime" — most users want overnight upgrades.
- [x] **"Anytime" reworded** to "Any time of day — upgrades may run while you're working", which is what no-restriction actually means.
- [x] **`[↵]` hints on every wizard prompt** so it's obvious what pressing Enter will do.
- [x] **Optional initial upgrade as final wizard step** — fixes the awkward "Last run: Never" right after setup; streams output to the terminal.
- [x] **"Useful commands" hint uses the `brew au` alias** since that's what you'll actually type.

## 1.0.3 — small bug-fix release

- [ ] **Tighten the `--window` regex.** Currently accepts `25:99-29:00`; should be `(?:[01][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]` on both sides.
- [ ] **Reject `--window 03:00-03:00`** (start == end produces an unreachable window).
- [ ] **Error on conflicting flags.** `brew au run --all --selected` silently takes the last flag; should fail loudly.
- [ ] **`gum` integration as optional prettier wizard.** Detect at runtime, use for `confirm`/`choose`/`input` if installed, fall back to current text prompts otherwise. Same pattern as fzf.

## 1.1 — polish

- [ ] **Cache `brew list | wc -l`** for `smart_hint`. Every `status` and `help` invocation currently waits 1-2s on a `brew list` call. Cache to `~/.config/brew-autoupgrade/.pkg-count` with a 24h TTL.
- [ ] **Auto-prune the allowlist** when a package is uninstalled. Either prune silently before a run, or surface a one-time message on `status`: *"node is in your allowlist but no longer installed — `brew au remove node`?"*.
- [ ] **Atomic config writes** for `schedule.conf` and `allowlist.txt`. Write to a tempfile + `mv` so an interrupted write can't leave a half-file.
- [ ] **Add `/opt/homebrew/sbin` to the plist `PATH`** for the rare formula that lives there.
- [ ] **`status` shows recent run health,** not just timestamp. Grep the last `═══` block in the log and surface `Last result: 12/12 succeeded` or `Last result: 2 failed (firefox, node)`.
- [ ] **Dry-run mode.** `brew au run --selected --dry-run` prints what would be upgraded without doing it.

## 1.2 — reliability

- [ ] **Multi-target internet probe.** Fall back from `1.1.1.1` to `8.8.8.8` to `captive.apple.com` before giving up. Corporate firewalls sometimes block Cloudflare specifically.
- [ ] **Atomic stop.** Roll back plist deletion if `launchctl bootout` fails, so we don't end up with a loaded service whose config file is gone.
- [ ] **Window-fit validation.** When user sets a `--window` narrower than `PLIST_INTERVAL` (4h), print a warning that they'll likely fall through to the 48h catch-up rather than running daily.
- [ ] **Lock-acquisition race during stale recovery.** Very narrow window where two stale-lock recoverers can both `rm -rf` and one of them ends up with no lock. Mostly benign because `mkdir` is atomic, but worth tightening.

## 1.3 — features

- [ ] **Notifications.** Optional `osascript -e 'display notification ...'` on a successful or failed run, gated by a `~/.config/brew-autoupgrade/notifications` flag.
- [ ] **Cleanup pass.** Run `brew cleanup` after a successful upgrade, behind a `--cleanup` flag or wizard option.
- [ ] **Failure backoff.** If a package fails N runs in a row, automatically mute it for a few days and surface in `status`.
- [ ] **`history` subcommand.** Reconstruct the last N runs from the log file.

## Long-term / maybe-never

- [ ] **Re-implement as a Homebrew "service" instead of a raw plist.** `brew services` is the conventional way; it'd lose some control over the plist but be more discoverable.
- [ ] **Linuxbrew support.** Replace `stat -f%z` and `launchctl` with portable equivalents; use `systemd --user` or cron on Linux.
- [ ] **Test suite.** Bats-based tests for the time-window math, the dedup/catch-up ladder, and the lock recovery.
